# Tor-Proxy-Rotator
A proxy rotator script for changing IP Address within a set time
This is a simple shell script that you can use to set a time for a rotating tor proxy. Simply run this script as sudo and follow the prompts.
I will be updating this scripts functionality in the future to be used on windows as well, and capabilities of time randomisation.

`sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y`
